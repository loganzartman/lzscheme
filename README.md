# lzscheme

A simple, hacked-together scheme interpreter designed to run the examples in The Little Schemer exactly as printed. Alternatively, this is an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of ~Common Lisp~ GNU/MIT Scheme<sup>[1][rule]</sup>

I'm implementing this as I go along, with no previous Scheme experience and poor training in compilers. I got bored so now I'm adding random scheme features to write toy programs with.

## usage

* REPL: `python lzscheme.py`
* Run script: `python lzscheme.py < file.scm`
* tests: `python -m pytest`
